# Dommie v0.0.1c
A TinyGo DOM library I use for a lot of projects. It's very basic, so probably
not what you are looking for.

## Demo
Yup, there's one at <https://ewaldhorn.github.io/dommie/>

## Why though
I don't know, really. This started as a quick helper and now it's a thing. Sorry.

## How
This uses [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) to build small wasm objects that you can
then use in the browser. I often write wasm programs for clients where I need to
interact with the DOM in the browser from Go.  So I decided to combine all the
different little bits and pieces of code I have into a single library so that I
can maintain it in just one place.
